# Additional Considerations

 - [ ] 1. Security Enhancements:
Consider rate limiting OTP verification attempts to prevent brute force attacks
You might want to implement a maximum attempt count before temporarily locking verification

 - [ ] 2. User Experience:
You could add a resend OTP functionality for cases where the email is delayed or the OTP 
expires. Consider adding alternative delivery methods (SMS) for the OTP

 - [ ] 3. Recovery Process:
Implement a mechanism to handle cases where users lose access to their email 
during registration

 - [-] 4. Cleaning db:
Delete expired OTPs
